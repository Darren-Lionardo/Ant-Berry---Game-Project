# Ant-Berry---Game-Project

Hello there!
This is a game that me and my teammates made during the Global Game Jam 2021 :)
Not gonna lie it was a hustle but it was worth it

Interestingly, we made this game in just 2 days! I'd say that's pretty Pog

I wish i could credit them but they don't have a GitHub Account...
So instead, if you want you can check this link for the full game release that you can play for your self!
It also shows all of the members in my team. That's one way to credit them :)

So here's the link to the game :)

Enjoy!
